### Doing things

#### <a href="/netflix-hover/">**netflix, old tv app**</a>
- My old non smart TV's pre-installed Netflix app had this design while navigating left / right with the remote.
- I remember it looked very cool and wanted to recreate it quickly.
- `CSS pseudo-class :focus-within`

#### <a href="/polling-animation/">**polling component**</a>
- Visual indication, animated countdown until a certain action happens.
- `void HTMLElement.offsetWidth`
